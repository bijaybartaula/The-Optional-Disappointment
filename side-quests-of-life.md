# Side Quests of Life: How I Keep Getting Distracted from My Main Mission

Life is full of grand ambitions, serious goals, and a deep sense of purpose that drives us forward. Yet, somehow, there's always something pulling us away from the main mission. Like an adventurer in an RPG, I find myself constantly derailed by side quests that feel just as urgent as the main plot—if not more so. In some ways, I love these distractions, but they also have a funny way of leaving me wondering whether I'll ever reach the end of my personal "main quest." At the same time, I've realized these side quests may just be the secret to actually leveling up in life.

If you’ve ever played an RPG—whether it’s a massive open-world game like *The Witcher 3*, or a more linear experience like *Final Fantasy*—you know exactly what I mean. You start off with a clear objective: defeat the final boss, save the world, solve the mystery, or whatever your main mission happens to be. But along the way, you're greeted with a million side quests—NPCs in need of help, strange landmarks to explore, treasure chests to unlock. You can never ignore these opportunities because they seem so *fun*, so *rewarding*, even if they completely divert you from your original mission.

In real life, I’m constantly navigating my own side quests. Every new hobby, every fleeting project, every cool idea that pops into my head is like a little detour on the road to my ultimate goals. And let me tell you, these side quests are *so* much fun. But they also serve as constant reminders that getting to the finish line isn’t always a straight path.

It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle of the main quest—chasing the dream, grinding to succeed, always looking for that endgame. But the truth is, life doesn't always work in a straight line. And maybe that’s okay.

## The Quest for Balance: The Main Mission vs. Side Quests

Let’s be real. The main quest in life feels pretty damn intimidating at times. Whether it's achieving professional success, maintaining personal growth, or fulfilling long-term dreams, it’s a huge undertaking. It requires discipline, intense focus, and, quite frankly, a lot of patience. But there’s something about the side quests that make them irresistibly appealing. They're smaller, more manageable, and the rewards come faster. It’s a quick hit of satisfaction when you’ve been grinding on a big goal for months, or even years.

Take starting a new hobby, for example. Maybe I’m focused on writing a book (the *main quest*), but then I stumble across a new creative project—let's say learning to play the guitar. Suddenly, I’m sucked into a world of scales, chords, and YouTube tutorials. I tell myself it’s just for a little bit, that I’ll come back to the book after I've gotten the basics down. But a few weeks later, I realize I’ve put more hours into learning guitar than writing my book, and my main quest is now collecting dust in the corner.

I start to think about all the other things I’ve tried and abandoned. A fitness routine, a podcast idea, a business venture. I’ve got a graveyard of unfinished projects. Each one started with excitement, passion, and the belief that *this* was the one that would stick. But instead, they all end up taking a back seat to the next distraction, and I’m left with the sinking feeling that maybe I’m not cut out for the big things. I begin to ask myself: Is this the curse of too many side quests? Or is it the blessing of someone who refuses to settle for just one story?

It’s easy to feel defeated, but here’s the comeback: The truth is, the main quest will always be waiting. It doesn’t matter how many side quests I take on because each detour brings new lessons, new skills, and new insights into who I am. So long as I keep moving forward, I’m still leveling up. Maybe I won’t complete everything in one go—but that doesn’t mean I’m not moving closer to my endgame.

## Leveling Up: The Power of Distraction

I’ve come to realize that these distractions often provide unexpected benefits. Much like side quests in RPGs that offer valuable gear, experience points, or even new abilities, the things that pull me off course usually leave me better equipped for my main mission. These seemingly irrelevant detours allow me to level up in unexpected ways.

Think about it. Take a break from writing to learn a new skill, and you might discover that your creativity is enhanced. I’ve found that sometimes, a short detour into something completely unrelated can spark a new level of thinking, and I’ll bring those ideas back to the main quest later. Stop focusing solely on your career for a while, and you may come back with a fresh perspective or even a new network of contacts. You might meet a mentor, or discover an insight that transforms the way you approach your bigger goal. The “side quests” in life may seem like they’re derailing me, but in the long run, they’re making me a more well-rounded, resourceful individual.

At the start of a new side quest, there’s always the possibility of finding something game-changing—a hidden treasure, a secret technique, or an NPC who becomes integral to the overall plot. That’s the beauty of side quests: they’re the unpredictable moments that can completely alter the trajectory of your main journey. 

One of the more obvious examples is the way working on a smaller, unrelated project can spark ideas for the larger goal. In an RPG, you might take on a seemingly trivial quest, only to find out that it ties into the larger story in unexpected ways—like discovering an ancient artifact that helps you take down the final boss. I’ve experienced similar moments in my own life, where pursuing something entirely different has actually given me the insight or motivation I needed to power through a larger challenge.

Even when I’ve totally neglected my main goal for weeks in favor of these "leveling-up" side quests, I come back stronger, more focused, and ready to tackle the original mission. The distraction wasn’t a waste of time—it was the experience points I needed to unlock the next level of my growth.

## The Chaos of Unfinished Projects: The Shadow of the Side Quest

But here’s where things get real. Side quests come with their own cost—unfinished business. They start out with so much excitement and promise, but then—just like in RPGs—you hit a point where the quest feels irrelevant or the next objective becomes overwhelming. There are so many times when I’ve walked away from a project feeling like I’ve just wasted hours or days on something that ultimately didn’t matter.

The truth is, the side quests often come with a sense of unfinished business. I’ve invested time, energy, and emotion into something that just fizzled out. It’s frustrating. When I look at the big picture, I sometimes wonder if I’ve just been chasing the next shiny object instead of focusing on the path ahead. Did I waste time or was it all part of the journey? The answer isn’t always clear.

But here’s the comeback: You don’t *always* need to finish everything. The key is knowing when it’s time to close a chapter. Maybe a side quest isn’t meant to be finished in one go. Maybe it’s meant to teach you something. So many of these distractions have helped me find my voice, grow my confidence, or simply learn how to get out of my own way. So when I get overwhelmed by the pile of unfinished projects, I remember that it’s the journey that matters, not just the destination.

## The Art of Balancing Main Quests and Side Quests

I’ve learned that there’s an art to balancing main quests and side quests in life. Yes, there’s a time to buckle down, grind, and complete the main mission. But there’s also a time to embrace the distractions that make life colorful. Life is dynamic, and there’s no shame in taking breaks, going off-track, or getting lost in the process.

Sometimes, a side quest might be exactly what you need to recharge. It’s the creative detour, the weekend trip, or the hobby you pick up out of nowhere. These moments aren’t just distractions—they’re catalysts for new perspectives, new energy, and new ideas. The challenge is understanding that side quests are an integral part of life’s design. They aren’t the enemy of success. They’re just as necessary as the main quest, even if they aren’t always directly aligned with the endgame.

Perhaps the key is in understanding that every side quest, no matter how seemingly unrelated, is part of the larger story. The skills I pick up along the way, the people I meet, and the lessons I learn all contribute to my growth as a person. They may not always be a direct line to my main goal, but they form the tapestry of my journey. In the grand RPG of life, it’s the side quests that give it richness and depth.

## The Final Boss: Focusing on the Endgame

Ultimately, it’s about knowing when to focus on the final boss and when to take a break for side quests. There’s a time to buckle down, grind, and complete the main mission. But there’s also a time to embrace the distractions that make life colorful. After all, there’s no joy in finishing a game if you haven’t enjoyed the world you’ve explored along the way.

So, here I am, juggling my main mission and the countless side quests life throws my way. I know there’s always a temptation to chase after the next shiny thing, but I’m learning that the journey itself is just as important as the destination. And who knows? Maybe all these detours will lead me to a place I never expected, but one that’s even better than I imagined.

In the end, it’s not about completing every side quest. It’s about knowing when to move on, when to grind through the main story, and when to take a breath and level up. The side quests? They’re just part of the adventure.

Until then—happy questing!
