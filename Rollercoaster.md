# The-Optional-Disappointment

Welcome to **The-Optional-Disappointment** repository! 

This is where side projects come to shine—or more accurately, where they go to sleep (sometimes forever). Dive into the highs, lows, and hilarious truth of side-projects. If you’ve ever started a project full of enthusiasm only to abandon it weeks later, you’re in good company. We’re all just trying to make it in the world of *optional* disappointment.

## Blog: The Reality of Side Projects: Dream or Distraction?

We’ve all been there—sitting at our desks, staring blankly at the screen, scrolling through some random social media platform, and then, like a bolt of lightning, it hits: *“I need a side project!”* You know, something *extra* to add to your already full plate of responsibilities. Something that’ll look impressive, boost your productivity, and possibly even change your life. 

But here’s the kicker: side-projects don’t usually work out that way. In fact, they often turn into something much different: distractions, time sinks, and unfinished hobbies that serve as little more than a reminder of your *failed* ambitions. 

Welcome to the reality of side-projects.

### The Excitement Stage

When you first come up with your side-project idea, you’re on fire. It could be anything from a blog you’re going to write (obviously), an app you’re definitely going to build, or a YouTube channel where you *swear* you’ll post weekly. You’ve read all the productivity blogs, watched all the motivational TED Talks, and downloaded every possible productivity app known to man.

You're ready to show the world your brilliance, armed with nothing but a vague idea, a sense of determination, and 15 tabs open in your browser with how-to guides and inspirational quotes.

The first couple of days go great. You’re in the zone. You create some content, lay out some plans, and feel like a true entrepreneurial genius. This is it—you’re finally going to make it. You're *making moves*, baby.

But slowly, the shine starts to wear off.

### The "I’ll Get to It Later" Stage

As life gets in the way—work deadlines, family obligations, personal burnout—you realize the side project is slipping into the back of your mind. But no worries, right? You’ll “get to it later.” You’re just too busy now.

Days turn into weeks. Weeks turn into months. Your idea that you were so passionate about is now a faint memory, gathering digital dust in a folder titled "Side Projects - 2025" that you'll probably never open again.

You tell yourself: "Once I get through this hectic month, I’ll jump right back into it." Spoiler alert: you won’t.

### The Existential Crisis of Side-Projects

Let’s be honest: at some point, you’re going to ask yourself why you started this in the first place. Was it because you genuinely cared about it? Or was it to prove something to yourself (or to the world) about how *productive* you are? Maybe you were just bored, and the side-project filled the void temporarily.

The thing about side-projects is that they’re often born from a place of guilt or pressure. You see others creating, innovating, and succeeding, so you think, "Well, I can do that too!" But what we often forget is that we’re already juggling a hundred things—work, social obligations, self-care, and hopefully some sleep—and adding a side-project just piles on more stress.

It’s easy to get caught up in the idea of side-projects being this glorious thing that’ll one day transform your life, but more often than not, they end up being distractions that just leave you feeling guilty for not following through. And that’s where the existential crisis begins.

### The Struggle Is Real: Why Side Projects Fail

There are plenty of reasons side-projects often fizzle out. Here are some of the top culprits:

1. **Lack of Time**: This is the big one. We all want to make time for the things we love, but the reality is, if you’re already stretched thin with work or other commitments, the time to nurture a side-project is hard to come by.  
2. **Shiny Object Syndrome**: You start one side-project, and then, within a week, you’re already jumping to the next shiny idea. You get excited about something new, abandoning the previous project in the dust.  
3. **Perfectionism**: We want things to be perfect, but sometimes, that’s paralyzing. Instead of getting anything done, we end up stuck in a loop of “this isn’t good enough yet” and end up doing nothing.  
4. **Lack of Accountability**: Unlike your 9-5 job, no one is keeping track of your progress. Without that external pressure, it’s easy to let things slide and put the project off until “later.”

### The 'Return to Reality' Stage: Coming to Terms with Your Side Project

So, now you’ve probably come to terms with the fact that your side-project isn’t going anywhere. Maybe you’ll come back to it at some point—or maybe not. It’s hard to say.

But here's the thing: It’s okay. Seriously.

Not every idea is meant to be a big success, and not every side-project needs to turn into a business or creative masterpiece. Some side-projects are just there to scratch an itch, try something new, or simply learn. In fact, many of us gain more from the process itself than from the end result.

If you’re a perfectionist or someone who struggles to follow through, here’s an important realization: you’re not alone. Most people have started some side-project with the best of intentions, only to watch it quietly fade into oblivion. And that’s fine.

### The Beauty of Letting Go

Rather than seeing side-projects as a failure, maybe it’s time to reframe them. Maybe instead of aiming for perfection, you should focus on just enjoying the creative process without worrying about the outcome. Side-projects can be a way to dabble in things you’re passionate about, even if they never take off. They can be *fun*, not a burden.

And hey, if your side-project fizzles out, it’s okay. You learned something. You tried something new. You practiced discipline and creativity. Even if you didn’t end up with a startup or viral blog, that’s still progress in its own way.

### Final Thoughts: The Side-Project Freedom

So, the next time you feel that impulse to start something new—whether it’s an app, blog, podcast, or some other wildly ambitious idea—take a moment to ask yourself why. Is it something you truly want to do? Or is it just the pressure to *do* something that’s motivating you?

Remember, side-projects are optional. They’re not a requirement for success or happiness. And if they turn out to be a "time sinkhole," as many do, that’s okay too. Life is too short to take them too seriously.

After all, it’s better to try and laugh at the mess you made than to never try at all.

### Inspirational Quotes to Keep in Mind

1. **"Done is better than perfect."** – Sheryl Sandberg  
   Remember, progress is better than perfection. Don’t get caught in the loop of trying to make everything flawless—sometimes, completing something (even if it’s not perfect) is what matters.

2. **"The best way to predict the future is to create it."** – Abraham Lincoln  
   Side-projects may not always turn out how you imagine, but they’re still opportunities to create, innovate, and grow. You’re crafting your own future, one experiment at a time.

3. **"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."** – Winston Churchill  
   Whether your side-project thrives or fizzles, remember: it's all part of the process. Keep going, and you’ll always gain something from the experience.

4. **"The only way to do great work is to love what you do."** – Steve Jobs

### Solutions to Help You Succeed (Or Just Have Fun)

1. **Set Realistic Goals**: Start small. Instead of aiming for a fully functional app, focus on creating a prototype. Instead of committing to writing 5 blog posts a week, aim for one a month. Keep things achievable.

2. **Schedule Your Side Project**: Treat your side-project like any other responsibility. Schedule time each week to work on it, even if it’s just 30 minutes. It’s about consistency, not intensity.

3. **Find Accountability Partners**: Share your goals with someone else—a friend, colleague, or online community. Having someone to check in with can help keep you on track.

4. **Allow Yourself to Let Go**: If you’re feeling overwhelmed or bored with a project, it’s okay to stop. Let go of the guilt and start something new when you’re ready. No project is worth sacrificing your happiness.

5. **Enjoy the Process**: It’s easy to get caught up in the end goal, but don’t forget to enjoy the journey. Side-projects are about learning, experimenting, and having fun. Focus on that, and you’ll find satisfaction regardless of the outcome.
