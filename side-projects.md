# Side Projects Are a Scam (But I Love Them Anyway)

## Introduction

We all know the drill: one day, you're sitting at your desk, overwhelmed by work or the daily grind, and then—BAM! The idea strikes. A new side project forms in your mind. It could be a blog, a side hustle, a fitness goal, or even a new hobby you’re eager to dive into. You get that rush of excitement—the thrill of something new, the idea that *this* is going to be the one that takes off, the one you finish, the one that changes everything. 

But deep down, you know the truth: **side projects are a scam**. 

Yet, despite this reality, we love them. We keep coming back to them, again and again. Why? What is it about these elusive, half-finished creations that keep us hooked? The answer isn’t straightforward, but it’s worth exploring. In this readme, we’ll dive deep into the nature of side projects—the lies we tell ourselves, the motivation they provide, and the reason we can’t stop starting them.

## The Illusion of Productivity

Starting a side project feels amazing. It’s like you’re breaking free from your routine. You’re in control, doing something that feels **fresh**, **exciting**, and above all, **productive**. But let’s be real for a moment: the bulk of the “work” is often in our minds, not in the actual execution. 

At first, it’s all fun and games. Brainstorming ideas, watching YouTube tutorials, sketching plans, buying equipment—you’re riding high on the wave of excitement, convinced this side project will be *the one*. But soon enough, the novelty wears off. The energy starts to fade. The fun of **idea generation** gives way to the grind of **execution**, and that’s where things get tricky.

You’ve spent hours on research, you’ve even gotten a few things done, but somewhere along the way, it starts to feel like the project has lost its magic. Maybe life gets in the way, or maybe you just lose interest. The problem? **The illusion of productivity**. You’ve spent all this time *feeling* like you’re moving forward, but in reality, you haven’t crossed the finish line. In fact, you may never reach it.

## Why Do We Do It?

You might ask yourself: if we know that most side projects won’t be finished, why do we keep starting them? The simple answer: because **we want the fun**. 

The idea of a side project offers a sense of control, a chance to break free from the routines of daily life, and a feeling of **creation**. Starting something new feels empowering—it’s as if you’re stepping into the unknown, ready to create something valuable. And while we often don’t finish, the initial spark of creativity and the thrill of newness make it all worth it, even if we never see the project to completion.

Additionally, there’s something satisfying about the act of **beginning**. The start of any new project is filled with potential. It’s a time of high energy, ideas flowing freely, and a sense of possibility. **But it’s the possibility that’s intoxicating, not the execution.** The problem is that the momentum tends to die down once the novelty wears off and you realize how much effort is actually required to get the project over the finish line. The grind of staying focused and maintaining consistency often loses out to our restless search for the next exciting idea.

## The Distraction You Didn’t Know You Needed

Side projects serve as **distractions**. And honestly, that’s often the most honest and fulfilling reason we dive into them. They take us away from the pressures of life, work, or responsibilities, providing an escape into a world where we can create on our own terms. 

But here’s where it gets tricky: in that distraction, we feel like we’re being productive. **It’s a clever trick of the mind.** You might not be solving a work problem or finishing a project that’s paying your bills, but you’re working on *something*, and that feels good. It feels like you’re checking things off, even when you’re not.

However, distraction does not equate to long-term progress. We get so caught up in the excitement of starting something new that we overlook the deeper commitment required to see it through. But maybe that’s the point. Side projects don’t have to be about the end result. Sometimes, they’re simply about **temporary fulfillment**, a brief escape from routine.

## The Cycle of Starting, Stopping, and Starting Again

The pattern is as predictable as it is infuriating: 

1. **Start a new side project** with great enthusiasm.
2. **Lose interest** after a while, maybe because the project feels less exciting, or because life just gets in the way.
3. **Start another side project**, convinced this time will be different. 

It’s a cycle we can’t seem to break. Every time we start something new, we’re filled with hope and optimism. Every time we stop, we’re left with the **guilt of unfinished business**. The cycle continues, but somehow, we never seem to fully give up. We know that the odds are slim, but the possibility that this *could* be the one—the one that makes a lasting impact—keeps us going.

## Little Truths and the Motivation to Keep Going

Despite the inevitability of unfinished projects, there are small truths we can glean from our side projects:

1. **Side projects are personal experiments.** Even if they don’t succeed, you learn something about yourself, your interests, and your limits.
   
2. **The process matters more than the result.** Sometimes the journey is more rewarding than the destination. The skills you learn, the knowledge you gain, and the moments of creativity are valuable—even if they never become tangible outcomes.

3. **The dream isn’t always about finishing.** It’s about starting, experimenting, and giving yourself permission to create. It’s about breaking free from the grind, even if for just a few hours, and indulging in something that brings you joy.

So, **why do we love side projects** despite their flaws? Because, in the end, they are **ours**—our moments of creative freedom, our opportunity to break free from routine, and our chance to experiment without the weight of perfection or the pressure of results. We love them for what they give us in the short term: **joy, learning, and an escape from the ordinary**.

## The Final Word

Let’s face it: side projects are a scam. They trick us into thinking we’re being productive when we’re really just chasing the illusion of progress. But maybe that’s okay. Maybe we’re not supposed to finish every side project we start. Maybe the value is in the act of starting, the process of creation, and the joy of exploring new ideas.

So, let’s embrace the scam. Let’s keep starting side projects, knowing full well that many of them will remain unfinished. **And that’s perfectly fine**.

Because, ultimately, side projects are not about completion—they’re about expression, growth, and the freedom to create on our own terms. So let’s continue starting them, knowing that every unfinished project is still a step forward in our journey of self-discovery.
