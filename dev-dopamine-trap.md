# The Dev Dopamine Trap

## What’s this about?

We’ve all been there. You get excited about a new project idea—whether it’s an app, a tool, or just something to scratch your own itch. You dive in, set up your repo, start building. It’s fast, fun, and rewarding. The initial rush is real. But soon, the work gets harder, the novelty fades, and you find yourself abandoning the project in favor of something new.

This pattern? It’s called the **Dev Dopamine Trap**. And if you’ve experienced it, you’re not alone.

## What Is the Dev Dopamine Trap?

The Dev Dopamine Trap is a cycle that many developers, creators, and builders fall into: the constant habit of starting new projects for the excitement of the idea, only to abandon them once the novelty wears off and the real work begins.

Here’s how it plays out:

- **The Idea**: You come up with a fresh, exciting idea for a project. You can already picture the end result in your mind. 
- **The Start**: You dive in. Spin up a repo, set up the dev environment, start coding. It feels great at first. The dopamine kick is real.
- **The Dip**: A few weeks in, things get harder. Bugs appear. Features become tedious to implement. The dopamine high fades, and so does your interest.
- **The Abandonment**: You lose focus and move on to the next big idea. The project gets forgotten, stored away with others you’ve never finished.

And just like that, your “Projects” folder fills up with half-completed repos that never see the light of day.

## Why Does This Happen?

It all comes down to dopamine.

### The Role of Dopamine

Dopamine is the brain’s motivation molecule. It’s not about pleasure—it’s about anticipation and reward. When you think about starting a new project, your brain gets a rush of dopamine because you're excited about what could be. But once the novelty fades, and the tedious, often boring work sets in, that rush disappears. Your brain then looks for the next fix, and you’re left jumping from one new idea to the next without ever finishing what you started.

This is why starting new projects feels so exciting. The rush is addictive, but finishing? That’s where the real work lies. And the rush of starting a new project doesn’t always translate to the effort required to bring it to completion.

## The Problem With Chasing the High

You might think constantly starting and abandoning projects isn’t that big of a deal. But it’s actually a problem for a few reasons.

### You Don’t Build Momentum

Momentum is key to success. The more you finish, the more confident you get in your ability to tackle difficult projects. But if you abandon your projects too soon, you never build that momentum. You stay stuck in a loop of starting without finishing.

### You Stay Shallow

When you jump from project to project, you’re only scratching the surface. You don’t give yourself the time to really dive deep into any one thing. If you want to master something, you need to stick with it through the rough patches—the parts that aren't exciting but are essential to growth.

### You Lose the Chance to Make an Impact

A finished project, even if it’s small, creates value. Whether that’s for you, for someone else, or just for the sake of getting better, an unfinished project doesn’t help anyone. It’s the difference between having a lot of ideas and actually shipping something.

### You Waste Energy

Every time you start a new project, there’s an energy cost—setting up your environment, researching the tools, learning new frameworks, and getting everything running. That’s a lot of mental effort. When you abandon the project midway, all that energy is wasted, and you’ve gained nothing.

## Why Developers Are More Susceptible

It’s not your fault that you fall into this trap. Developers, in particular, are prone to it for a few reasons:

### The Constant Flow of New Tools

Tech is always evolving. There’s always something new to try—whether it’s a new JavaScript framework, a cool API, or a shiny productivity tool. It’s easy to get distracted and start something new every time a new tool or framework comes along.

### Prototyping Is Easy

Thanks to modern frameworks and tools, it’s incredibly easy to spin up a new project quickly. You can have something up and running in just a few hours. The initial rush is fast, which makes it tempting to dive into something new each time. But as soon as things start to get difficult, you lose interest.

### Instant Feedback Feels Good

Developers love feedback, and starting a new project gives you instant feedback. You can quickly see your work come together—first commits, early features, pull requests—it feels like progress. But once the project hits a rough patch, the feedback slows down, and the dopamine high fades.

### The Shiny New Thing

When you build in public or share your work, there’s validation in starting a new project. The excitement of announcing your idea is often more celebrated than the actual process of building and finishing it. The attention often goes to the *start* rather than the finish.

## How to Break Free From the Dev Dopamine Trap

You don’t need to abandon the excitement of starting new projects—but you do need to build better habits around it. Here’s how you can start breaking the cycle:

### Redefine What Success Looks Like

Instead of trying to build the next big thing, aim for smaller, achievable goals. Ship something simple. Finish one feature. Write that blog post. Don’t wait for perfection—finish something small, and let that be enough for now. Celebrate those smaller wins.

### Limit Your Inputs, Focus on Outputs

If you’re constantly starting new projects, it’s time to limit your intake. Start saying no to new ideas that distract you from what you’re currently working on. If a new idea pops up, jot it down and park it for later. Keep your focus on finishing what you’ve already started.

### Embrace the Boring Stuff

Let’s be real—most of the work on any project is boring. Refactoring code, fixing bugs, writing tests—it’s not glamorous, but it’s necessary. Instead of getting distracted by the exciting bits, learn to push through the boring parts. That’s where the real progress happens.

### Celebrate the Small Wins

Focus on the process. Celebrate getting one step closer to completion. The small, mundane tasks add up, and they’re what allow you to get the big things done. Acknowledge that refactoring code or writing documentation is just as important as building new features.

### Make Your Progress Public

Tell someone—anyone—what you’re working on. Share your progress regularly. When you make your work public, it’s harder to abandon the project, because now you’ve made a commitment. Not for validation, but to show you can finish what you start.

## Conclusion: Finish What You Start

The Dev Dopamine Trap is something many of us fall into, but it doesn’t have to be a permanent cycle. The key is to focus less on starting and more on finishing. It’s not about how many projects you start—it’s about how many you finish.

The excitement of starting something new will always be there, but the real value comes from sticking with it, pushing through the tough parts, and seeing things to completion. That’s where the magic happens.

So, next time you get that rush to start a new project, pause. Ask yourself: “Do I really need a new idea, or do I need to finish the one I already started?”

Because, in the end, finishing is what makes all the effort worthwhile.
