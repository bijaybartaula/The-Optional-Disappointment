## Moodboards, Wireframes, and Other Lies I Tell Myself

**When the design is stunning, but the actual app never even reaches a single route.**

There’s a folder on my desktop labeled “Startups.” Inside it are subfolders with names like *NimbusOS*, *EchoJournal*, *Maple*, *Quanta*, and a dozen other sleek, evocative titles that sound like they belong on Product Hunt’s front page. Inside those folders are designs — beautiful, thoughtful, sometimes obsessive designs. Color palettes. Font hierarchies. Responsive mockups. Components upon components. All meticulously built out in Figma.

But if you trace these projects beyond the design layer, they drop off a cliff. There’s no code. No routes. No backend. No version control. Not even a `README.md`. Just the mockups, silently whispering what could have been.

This is the world I live in — a twilight zone between ideation and execution. A space where ideas are taken just far enough to feel satisfying, but never far enough to function.

So this is a confession. And maybe a warning. Or a love letter. To every moodboard, wireframe, and prototype I’ve ever created — and the beautiful lies I’ve told myself along the way.

### Act I: The Romance of Starting

It usually starts with an itch. An idea scribbled on a napkin or typed into my phone at 2AM. A gap in the market. A problem I’ve experienced. An app I wish existed.

I give the idea a name. I design a logo. I spend an hour choosing the *right* typeface. Then I move into Figma and begin building the dream: sleek onboarding screens, minimalist UI, elegant shadows, quirky microinteractions. By the end of the day, I have a product that looks ready for TechCrunch.

Except it’s not. It’s not a product at all. It’s a very pretty collection of pixels — zero functionality, zero infrastructure. But somehow, that doesn’t matter in the moment. Because at this stage, I’m in love.

And love, especially in the creative phase, is intoxicating.

### Act II: The Lies We Tell

Here are the lies I tell myself in this phase — maybe you’ve heard them too:

* “I need to finish the design system before I start coding.”
* “Once I nail the UX flow, development will be easy.”
* “I just want the MVP to *feel* polished from the beginning.”
* “I’ll write the backend once the UI is final.”
* “It’s not procrastination, it’s *preparation*.”

But deep down, I know the truth: these are rationalizations. Elaborate excuses designed to keep me in the honeymoon phase, where everything is possible and nothing is hard.

Because starting is easy. Shipping is hard.

### Act III: The Gravity of Reality

Eventually, reality shows up.

Maybe I try to explain the app to a friend and they say, “Cool, can I try it?”
Maybe I open a new project in VS Code and stare blankly at the blinking cursor.
Maybe I realize that deploying a full-stack app takes more than imagination.

Suddenly, things get technical. Messy. Concrete. It’s not about picking the perfect shade of blue — it’s about setting up routes, configuring auth, dealing with state. It’s debugging CORS issues, integrating third-party APIs, writing documentation.

Design is immediate and forgiving. Code is slow and brutally honest.

You can’t hand-wave your way through a database schema.

### Act IV: Why Design Feels Safer

There’s a reason we linger in Figma and Notion and Whimsical. It feels safe. It feels productive. It *looks* like progress — and to some extent, it is. Good design is important. Thoughtful UX is non-negotiable.

But the problem isn’t design itself. It’s when design becomes a crutch. When it becomes the thing we hide behind instead of the thing that pushes us forward.

Because it’s far easier to mock up a “dark mode” toggle than it is to implement user preferences. Easier to design five onboarding screens than to integrate OAuth. Easier to simulate data than to architect a real-time backend.

Design gives you the illusion of a finished product. Development forces you to confront the truth.

### Act V: What Actually Matters

I’ve come to accept a hard truth: a mediocre product that exists is more valuable than a perfect design that doesn’t.

The real magic happens not in the mockup, but in the moment you hit your first working route. When you get your first API response. When a user — a real one — logs in, clicks around, and gives you feedback that isn't hypothetical.

That’s where progress lives. Not in the beauty of the design, but in the mess of the build.

That’s where things become *real*.

### Act VI: Relearning How to Build

So now I try to do it differently.

When I get an idea, I still open Figma. But I limit myself — maybe one screen, two max. Enough to clarify the concept, not to perfect the aesthetic. Then I open a terminal. I spin up a repo. I scaffold a basic project.

Even if it’s ugly. Even if it’s broken. Even if it’s a single component and a console log.

Because that’s the only way it becomes something.

I remind myself: design is a layer, not a destination. A phase, not a product. The sooner I start building, the sooner I find out whether the idea is actually viable — or just another beautiful figment of my imagination.

### Epilogue: Let the Design Follow the Build

To the dreamers and the designer-devs, I say this with love:

Ship the sketch. Wire up the button before it’s perfect. Push to GitHub even if you’re embarrassed. Let the design *follow* the functionality, not block it.

Perfection is the enemy of momentum. Don’t fall in love with your prototype before it’s proven it deserves the commitment.

Moodboards are great. Wireframes are useful. But in the end, the only app that matters is the one you actually build.

So make it real. Even if it’s ugly at first. Especially if it’s ugly at first.

Because no one ever changed the world with a .fig file.
