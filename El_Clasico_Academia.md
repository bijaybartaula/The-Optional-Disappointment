# El Clásico vs Me: A Semester Showdown of Spirit, Setbacks, and Chicken Awards

*When your greatest opponent is the person you used to be*

## The Opening Whistle

There's something profoundly lonely about competing against yourself. Not the motivational-poster version of self-improvement, but the brutal, unforgiving reality of having your past achievements stare you down like a rival team across the pitch. In the grand theater of academic life, I've discovered that the most devastating defeats don't come from external competitors—they come from the ghost of your former self, suited up in yesterday's glory, reminding you exactly how much better you used to be.

This is my El Clásico. Not the one played in Camp Nou or Santiago Bernabéu, but the one staged in lecture halls and examination rooms, where the stakes feel just as high and the emotions run just as deep. It's Real Madrid versus Barcelona, except both teams are me—separated only by time, circumstance, and the cruel arithmetic of grade point averages.

## Act I: The Phantom Goal (First Semester)

The story begins where all good underdog tales do: with injustice so clean and obvious that it could have been scripted by Hollywood. Basic Electrical Engineering—a subject that should have been my victory lap, turned into my first lesson in institutional fallibility.

I knew the material. I could feel the confidence coursing through my veins during the exam, that rare sensation of knowing exactly what you're doing while everyone around you seems to be drowning. The kind of performance that makes you walk out of an exam hall with your head high, already mentally composing the casual way you'll mention your success to friends and family.

Then came the results.

Failed. Not close-but-not-quite. Not needs-improvement. Failed.

There's a particular kind of disorientation that comes with receiving a result that contradicts everything you know about your own performance. It's like being told that gravity doesn't work on Tuesdays, or that the sky has always been green and you've simply been color-blind your entire life. The ground shifts beneath your feet, and suddenly you're questioning not just your academic abilities, but your capacity to perceive reality itself.

I did what any rational person would do: I paid for a re-evaluation. Not because I expected justice—institutional machinery rarely reverses itself—but because sometimes you need to exhaust every official channel before you can accept that the system is fundamentally broken. The re-evaluation was exactly what you'd expect: a bureaucratic theater where papers are shuffled, fees are collected, and the original decision is rubber-stamped with the authority of "due process."

But this story has a redemption arc.

A year later, when the subject came up for retake, I approached it with a different energy. Not the naive confidence of first semester, but the focused intensity of someone who had been wronged and was ready to prove it. Two to three days of concentrated study—not the panicked cramming of desperate students, but the surgical precision of someone who knew exactly what they were capable of.

The result: 4.0/4.0. Perfect score. Vindication served cold, twelve months later.

Ironically, I got the highest marks in the first semester (across both day and morning batches), but it wasn’t counted. Let’s call that semester a red card — skipped, but not forgotten.

There's a particular satisfaction in being proven right by time, in having your initial assessment validated by an identical system that had previously failed you. It doesn't erase the frustration of that first failure, but it does something perhaps more valuable: it confirms that your internal compass wasn't broken. The system was.

## Act II: The Familiar Sting (Second Semester)

Lightning, as they say, never strikes the same place twice. But institutional dysfunction? That's a renewable resource.

Data Structures and Algorithms—the kind of subject that computer science students either love or fear, with very little middle ground. I put in the work. Not the bare minimum, not the frantic last-minute push, but solid, consistent effort. The kind of preparation that should translate into results.

The grade that came back was mediocre. Not failing this time, but disappointingly average. The kind of grade that makes you wonder if you're losing your mind, if you've somehow forgotten how to evaluate your own understanding, if the confident student from just one semester ago was an illusion.

Pattern recognition is a fundamental skill in computer science, and the pattern here was becoming uncomfortably clear. Either I was systematically overestimating my own performance, or there was something fundamentally unreliable about the evaluation system I was navigating.

The doubt creeps in at moments like this. Not the healthy self-reflection that leads to improvement, but the corrosive uncertainty that makes you question everything you thought you knew about your own capabilities. It's the academic equivalent of the uncanny valley—everything looks familiar, but something essential is off, and you can't quite put your finger on what.

## Act III: The Golden Era (Third and Fourth Semesters)

Sometimes redemption comes not as a single moment of triumph, but as a sustained period of excellence that gradually rebuilds your confidence. Third and fourth semesters were my golden era—the Barcelona years of my personal El Clásico, when everything clicked and the world made sense again.

Enter the "Chicken Award."

Every institution has its own peculiar traditions, and ours was no exception. The Chicken Award—a name so absurd it could only have emerged from the specific combination of academic bureaucracy and student humor—was given to whoever topped their section. Both day and morning batches. It wasn't official recognition in any meaningful sense, but it was acknowledgment. It was proof that excellence, when sustained, becomes visible even to systems that often seem designed to overlook it.

Third semester: B+ in one subject, full grades in everything else. The single B+ was annoying in the way that small imperfections always are when you're reaching for perfection, but the overall performance was undeniable. First Chicken Award claimed.

Fourth semester: An A– this time, with full grades elsewhere. The pattern held. The system and I had found our rhythm. Second Chicken Award secured.

There's something deeply satisfying about consistent excellence, about becoming the kind of student whose name appears at the top of lists with regularity. Not because of single moments of brilliance, but because of sustained competence. It's the difference between being a flash in the pan and being a force to be reckoned with.

For two semesters, I was Barcelona at their peak—dominant, consistent, seemingly unstoppable. My past self from first and second semesters felt like a different person, someone who had struggled with systems and circumstances that now seemed perfectly manageable. I had cracked the code. I had figured out how to win.

## Act IV: The November 2010 Moment (Fifth Semester)

And then came fifth semester.

If you know football, you know about November 29, 2010. Camp Nou. El Clásico. Barcelona 5, Real Madrid 0. Not just a defeat, but a humiliation so complete, so comprehensive, that it transcended sports and became a cultural moment. The kind of loss that doesn't just affect the scoreboard—it affects your identity.

That's what fifth semester felt like.

My GPA dropped by 0.58 points. In the context of academic performance, that's not just a dip—it's a crater. It's the difference between being consistently excellent and being disappointingly average. More than the numbers, though, was the feeling. The sense that I had been outplayed not by external circumstances, but by my own previous standards.

In this personal El Clásico, I was Real Madrid walking into Camp Nou. My past self—the student who had won two consecutive Chicken Awards, who had dominated third and fourth semesters—was Barcelona. And Barcelona destroyed me.

There's a particular kind of humiliation that comes from being beaten by your own potential. It's not like losing to a better opponent, where you can at least respect the competition. It's like being outplayed by a recording of yourself from six months ago, a constant reminder of what you used to be capable of achieving.

The worst part wasn't the grades themselves—though they stung—but the knowledge that I had done it before. The capability existed. The track record was there. The only thing that had changed was me, and somehow I had become a lesser version of myself without even noticing the transition.

## The Cumulative Score: 3.70

Numbers tell stories, but they don't tell the whole story. A cumulative GPA of 3.70 across five semesters is objectively good. In most contexts, it's excellent. But numbers exist in relationship to expectations, to trajectories, to the narrative arc of your own journey.

3.70 is the mathematical average of triumph and disaster, of system failures and personal victories, of Chicken Awards and fifth-semester collapses. It's the sum total of every exam where I knew I had nailed it, every result that made no sense, every moment of confidence and every crisis of self-doubt.

But perhaps most importantly, 3.70 is not a conclusion. It's a scoreline at halftime.

## The Deeper Game

What strikes me most about this academic journey is how closely it mirrors the emotional architecture of actual El Clásicos. The anticipation, the preparation, the moments of brilliance, the inexplicable failures, the way individual performances can shift the entire narrative of who you think you are.

In football, El Clásico matters not just because of the quality of play, but because of what it represents. It's not just Barcelona versus Real Madrid—it's competing philosophies, different approaches to excellence, conflicting ideas about what matters most. When these teams meet, they're not just playing football; they're arguing about the nature of football itself.

My academic El Clásico works the same way. It's not just about grades or GPAs or even knowledge acquisition. It's about competing versions of myself, different approaches to learning, conflicting ideas about what academic success should look like. Each semester, these different versions of me meet on the pitch, and the results determine not just my transcript, but my understanding of who I am as a student and as a thinker.

The first-semester me believed in preparation and confidence. The second-semester me learned about institutional unpredictability. The third and fourth-semester me discovered the rhythm of sustained excellence. The fifth-semester me got a harsh lesson in the fragility of success.

Each version had something to teach the others. Each defeat and victory was part of a larger conversation about capability, effort, and the mysterious alchemy that transforms knowledge into grades.

## The Comeback Strategy

Real Madrid didn't stay down after November 2010. They regrouped, they adapted, and they came back stronger. The beauty of El Clásico is that it's never really over—there's always another match, another chance to rewrite the narrative.

Fifth semester was my 5-0 defeat, but it wasn't my final match. The humiliation was real, but so is the possibility of redemption. The student who won two consecutive Chicken Awards didn't disappear—they're still there, temporarily overshadowed but not eliminated.

The question isn't whether I can return to previous levels of performance. The question is whether I can learn from this cycle of rise and fall, whether I can become the kind of student who doesn't just excel in good conditions but who can maintain excellence even when the system seems stacked against them.

Maybe that's the real lesson of my personal El Clásico: not that success is guaranteed if you work hard enough, but that the game is never really over. There's always another semester, another chance to prove that the Barcelona version of yourself—the one who seemed unstoppable—wasn't a fluke but a preview of what's possible.

## Final Whistle (For Now)

The beautiful thing about El Clásico is that it never ends. Every match is both a conclusion and a beginning, a final score and a setup for the next encounter. My academic journey feels the same way—each semester ends with a grade, but the real competition is ongoing.

I am Real Madrid and I am Barcelona. I am the student who failed Basic Electrical Engineering despite knowing the material, and I am the student who came back a year later and aced it. I am the recipient of two consecutive Chicken Awards, and I am the person whose GPA dropped by 0.58 points in a single semester.

The scoreline reads 3.70, but the match is far from over.

In the end, maybe that's what makes this El Clásico worth watching: not the certainty of victory or defeat, but the ongoing tension between different versions of ourselves, the constant possibility of comebacks and collapses, the knowledge that every semester is both an ending and a beginning.

The next match is always just around the corner. And I intend to be ready for it.

*It's currently tied 2-2 in their personal El Clásico, with aggregate drama that would make Camp Nou jealous. The next fixture is scheduled for sixth semester. Tickets are not available to the public, but the emotional stakes remain as high as ever.* 

*Even if that moment never comes.*
