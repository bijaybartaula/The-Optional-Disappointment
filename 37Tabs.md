# Too Many Tabs, Not Enough Time: The Browser Battle I Keep Fighting

I’m no stranger to the chaos that is my browser. If you ever saw the state of it, you’d probably ask if I’m working or just drowning in the digital noise. I’m here to admit it: at any given moment, I have no less than 37 tabs open. It’s like a collection of my fleeting thoughts, ideas that could be the next big thing, and tutorials I swear I’ll follow through on—eventually. Some of them are articles I want to read “later,” others are things I need to check out “soon,” and then there are those random forums I visit where people are discussing bugs I don’t even have yet but feel I need to prepare for. 

The cycle starts innocently enough. I open my browser with a mission. I Google something relatively simple: *"How to optimize React rendering."* Simple enough, right? But one link leads to another, and before I know it, I’m learning about React Fiber architecture and wondering why I’m watching a conference talk from 2018. I tell myself, “I’ll definitely use this info soon,” and that leads to even more tabs—new tutorials, videos, blog posts, all building on each other, expanding my curiosity until I can’t keep up.

And then comes the inevitable: I open a new tab to start a new project that will test all the new things I’ve just learned. And that project? It’s going straight into the graveyard with all the others I’ve started and abandoned. My tabs—each one representing an idea I was *sure* would be my next big breakthrough—end up sitting there, neglected, waiting to be closed. 

## The Spiral of Curiosity

Curiosity is a blessing, but for me, it’s also a curse. It’s an uncontrollable force that turns my productivity into a never-ending spiral. I’ll start my day with the goal of fixing a single bug or learning a quick fix for a small issue, but that’s never how it ends. 

Take today, for instance. I just needed to optimize the React rendering in a project I’m working on. Simple, right? But as soon as I Google it, I find myself diving deeper into state management solutions, exploring different libraries, and watching videos on how to make your React app “lightning fast.” Suddenly, I’m designing the next groundbreaking app in Figma, tweaking user interfaces I’ve never even started to build. 

By the time I glance at the clock, it’s 3 a.m., and I’ve gone down a rabbit hole so deep that I forgot what I was doing in the first place. I went from debugging to designing and then to starting a completely new project, all because I couldn’t stop chasing the next interesting piece of information. 

The worst part? The whole cycle feels so productive in the moment. It’s like I’m learning something new with every click, but I’m still far from where I need to be. Every technology feels like *the one* that will make me a “10x developer.” That one tool, that new framework—it’ll change everything. Every new discovery gives me a rush, and that rush makes it so easy to think I’m actually accomplishing something. But in reality, I’m just accumulating tabs and ideas without executing on any of them.

## The Illusion of Productivity

I don’t know if you’ve ever had this experience, but when I have 37 tabs open, I often convince myself that I’m busy. Like, “Oh, I’m working hard here.” The problem is, none of these tabs are bringing me any closer to writing a single line of useful code. What I’m actually doing is hoarding information.

I’ve become a digital packrat, collecting knowledge, hoping that somehow it’ll transform me into the developer I want to be. The tabs, though—they’re not the solution. They’re just distractions, each one a tiny whisper of a better version of myself: the one who finishes projects, writes clean code, and *actually gets things done*. But the more tabs I have open, the less I feel like I’m accomplishing anything meaningful.

They’ve become my comfort zone, these tabs. Each one a tiny promise of productivity that never seems to pan out. I don’t need more information—I need to focus. But focus is hard when every tab feels like a little fire that needs to be put out.

## Side Projects Born From Guilt and Hype

And then, there are the side projects. Oh, the side projects. These are the direct results of all those tabs. They’re born out of excitement, but fueled by the guilt of never fully committing to the last thing I started. 

Like the AI-powered daily planner I built after watching a quick YouTube video. It was a good idea at the time. I thought it would be revolutionary. Of course, it was never finished. Or the custom CSS framework I started because Tailwind was “too mainstream” (what was I even thinking?). Then there’s the habit tracker I built, which I used for exactly one day. Yes, I tracked my habits that day, but that was the end of that project. It’s still there, lurking in the depths of my code repository, unused and incomplete.

Each of these side projects started with a burst of enthusiasm—“This is it! This is going to change everything!” But soon enough, the buzz fades, and I find myself back at square one, chasing the next shiny thing. 

I get caught in this cycle of “starting over” instead of finishing what I began. I jump from one idea to the next, always with the feeling that the next project will be the one that sticks, the one I’ll actually finish. And yet, here I am, staring at the same unfinished tabs that I had open months ago.

## The Day I Decide to Close Tabs

But, at some point, I can’t keep going like this. I’m overwhelmed by the clutter. The tabs are suffocating me. So, I snap. I close a chunk of them. It feels like ripping off a bandage, painful but strangely freeing. 

For a moment, my brain feels clear. There’s less noise. Less distraction. I focus on the task at hand, reminding myself why I started. I can see the end goal more clearly now. The truth is, I don’t need 37 tabs open. I need one. I need to remember the project that started it all—the one I wanted to finish. I need to go back to the basics and block out the distractions.

Closing those tabs doesn’t mean the end of curiosity—it just means I need to channel it into one thing. The reality is, I can’t keep learning all the things at once. I have to choose a path, stick to it, and see it through to the end.

## So, Here’s What I’ll Do

I’m not going to promise that I’ll be perfect. I’m not going to swear that I’ll never open another tab again. But I will try. I’ll try to close the tabs that don’t serve my current goals. I’ll try to finish the projects I start instead of chasing the next shiny object. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll give myself the space to focus.

So, here’s to all of us who are fighting the good fight against tab overload. May we find clarity in fewer open windows, and more meaningful progress. 

Until then... I’ll just leave this one tab open. You know, just in case.
