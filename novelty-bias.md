# Why My Brain Loves New Things and Hates Old Things
*A playful look at novelty bias, dopamine, and unfinished work*

---

My brain is a terrible project manager.

It gets wildly excited about new ideas, throws confetti at fresh possibilities, and then—somewhere between the honeymoon phase and actually finishing something—quietly slips out the back door like a deadbeat dad at a PTA meeting.

I have seventeen half-built apps, thirty-three abandoned blog drafts, and a folder on my desktop called "DEFINITELY GOING TO FINISH THIS" that hasn't been opened since 2020. My brain treats my project folder like a buffet: sample everything, commit to nothing, leave feeling slightly nauseous.

Welcome to the wonderful, chaotic world of novelty bias—where your dopamine receptors are basically that friend who gets bored three songs into every playlist.

## The Dopamine Casino in My Head

Here's what I've learned about my brain: it's essentially a tiny Vegas casino run by a hyperactive squirrel named Dopamine Dan. Every new project idea is like dropping quarters into the slot machine, and Dan goes absolutely *wild* for those shiny new possibilities.

"Oh, what's this? A productivity app that sorts your thoughts by color? *JACKPOT!*" 

"Wait, wait—now you want to build a social network for houseplants? *DING DING DING!*"

"Hold up, is that a half-formed idea about teaching coding through interpretive dance? *CASINO NOISES INTENSIFY*"

The problem is, Dopamine Dan has the attention span of a goldfish with ADHD. The moment the initial excitement wears off—usually around the time I have to actually figure out database architecture or write proper documentation—Dan wanders off to find shinier objects.

Meanwhile, I'm left staring at a half-implemented authentication system wondering why I thought building "Tinder for project collaborators" was going to change the world.

## The Graveyard of Good Intentions 

Let me take you on a tour of my personal Project Graveyard, where good intentions go to decompose into git repositories that haven't seen a commit in months:

**The Weather App That Would End All Weather Apps** (Last commit: "fixed typo in comment")
I was going to revolutionize how people think about weather by showing the emotional forecast alongside the meteorological one. "It's partly cloudy with a chance of existential dread." The UI looked amazing. The backend never happened.

**TaskMaster 3000: The To-Do App to Rule Them All** (Status: 73% complete, 0% used)
This was going to be different from the other 47,000 to-do apps because it would use machine learning to predict when I'd actually do things. Spoiler alert: the algorithm predicted I'd never finish building it. The algorithm was right.

**BlogBot: AI That Writes My Thoughts Better Than I Do** (Files: 1 README.md, 847 lines of ambitious pseudocode)
I spent three weeks researching natural language processing before realizing I should probably have actual thoughts worth writing about first. The irony was not lost on me.

**The Social Network for Introverts** (Tagline: "Where antisocial meets antisocial")
A platform where you could connect with people by actively avoiding them. Users would gain points for not messaging each other. I got distracted building the non-messaging system and forgot to build the actual social features.

Each of these projects started with the same intoxicating cocktail of possibility and delusion. I'd open a new terminal, create a fresh repository, and feel like I was about to birth the next unicorn startup from my laptop. Three days later, I'd be googling "how to center a div" for the millionth time and questioning my life choices.

## The Science of My Scattered Attention

Turns out there's actual science behind why my brain treats projects like speed dating—lots of initial excitement, very little long-term commitment.

Novelty bias is our evolutionary tendency to overvalue new information and experiences. Back when we were hunter-gatherers, this made sense. The rustle in a new type of bush might mean food or danger—both worth investigating. But now, in our modern world, every new project idea triggers that same "ooh, shiny!" response that once kept our ancestors alive.

Dopamine doesn't actually create pleasure—it creates *anticipation* of pleasure. It's the neurochemical equivalent of a movie trailer: all the exciting bits with none of the boring middle parts where character development happens. When I think about building something new, my brain floods with dopamine. When I'm actually debugging for the fourth hour straight, dopamine has left the building and taken the popcorn with it.

This is why starting projects feels like Christmas morning, but finishing them feels like doing taxes in February.

## The Paradox of Choice (and Commitment Issues)

Having infinite possibilities is both a blessing and a curse. I can build anything, which means I'm paralyzed by the option to build everything. My brain suffers from what psychologists call "choice overload"—the same phenomenon that makes me stand in the cereal aisle for twenty minutes unable to decide between Cheerios and Frosted Flakes, except with life-changing software projects.

The modern developer's curse is having access to every framework, every API, every possible tool to build anything imaginable. It's like being a kid in the world's largest toy store with unlimited money but ADHD and a curfew.

So I start building everything and finish nothing, creating what I like to call my "Empire of Unfinished Dreams"—a vast digital wasteland where good ideas go to gather dust and accumulate TODO comments.

## The Therapy Session My Code Can't Attend

Here's the thing about unfinished projects: they're not just abandoned code—they're abandoned pieces of myself. Each half-built app represents a version of me that was excited about something, believed in something, and then... didn't follow through.

My project folder is basically group therapy for failed ambitions:

"Hi, I'm WeatherMood, and I haven't been worked on in 247 days."
*"Hi, WeatherMood."*

"Hi, I'm TaskMaster 3000, and my creator forgot I existed the moment they discovered TikTok."
*"Hi, TaskMaster."*

"Hi, I'm... well, I don't actually have a name yet. I'm just called 'untitled-project-final-ACTUAL-final-v2.'"
*Awkward silence.*

The guilt of unfinished projects is real. They sit there in my repository list like accusatory digital ghosts, reminding me of all the times I chose Netflix over code reviews, sleep over debugging, or literally anything over writing documentation.

But here's what I'm learning: unfinished projects aren't failures—they're experiments. They're proof that I tried something, learned something, and moved on to try something else. They're like relationship experience for developers.

## The Art of Strategic Abandonment

I used to think finishing every project was a moral imperative, like I owed it to my past self to see every half-baked idea through to completion. This led to what I call "Sunk Cost Coding"—continuing to work on projects not because they were good ideas, but because I'd already invested time in them.

Now I practice strategic abandonment. Some projects deserve to die. Some ideas were only meant to live long enough to teach me something new or scratch a temporary itch. Some codebases are better off as learning experiences than production applications.

The trick is learning to distinguish between projects worth finishing and projects worth abandoning without feeling like a quitter. It's like Marie Kondo for code: does this project spark joy? Does it serve a purpose? Or is it just taking up mental real estate and making me feel guilty every time I see it?

## Embracing the Chaos (A Survival Guide)

So how do I live with a brain that collects projects like a digital hoarder? Here's my survival guide for fellow novelty addicts:

**Accept the Dopamine Cycle**: My brain is going to get excited about new things. That's not a bug, it's a feature. The key is riding the wave of initial excitement while building systems that help me push through the inevitable motivation valley.

**Build Minimum Viable Experiences**: Instead of trying to build the next Facebook, I focus on building the smallest possible thing that captures the core idea. Sometimes that's just a functioning prototype. Sometimes it's just detailed documentation of the concept. Both count as "finished" in their own way.

**Maintain a Project Triage System**: I categorize projects into "Active," "Paused," and "Archived." Active projects get regular attention. Paused projects are on hold but might be revisited. Archived projects are officially retired with honor. This helps me feel intentional about my chaos rather than just scattered.

**Celebrate Small Wins**: Learned a new API while building something I'll never finish? That's a win. Figured out a better way to structure React components? Win. Successfully deployed something to production, even if I never touch it again? Major win.

**Find Joy in the Journey**: The process of building is often more rewarding than the end result. I'm learning to appreciate the exploration, the problem-solving, the late-night coding sessions where everything clicks into place, even if the project never sees the light of day.

## The Unfinished Manifesto

Here's my manifesto for fellow members of the Unfinished Projects Club:

We are explorers, not finishers. We are driven by curiosity, not completion. We measure success in lessons learned, not products shipped. We find beauty in beginnings, potential in prototypes, and wisdom in walking away.

Our abandoned projects are not failures—they are stepping stones. Each unfinished app teaches us something about code, about ourselves, about what we actually want to build versus what we think we should build.

We are the digital equivalent of Renaissance inventors, sketching flying machines and underwater vessels in the margins of our notebooks, knowing that the act of imagining is often more valuable than the act of implementing.

## The Dopamine Detox (Just Kidding)

I could tell you to do a dopamine detox, to resist the siren call of new projects, to focus on finishing what you start. But that would be like telling a river to stop flowing or a cat to stop knocking things off tables. It goes against our fundamental nature.

Instead, I'm learning to channel my novelty addiction in productive ways. New projects can be playgrounds for experimenting with technologies I want to learn. They can be safe spaces for trying out ideas without the pressure of perfection. They can be gifts to my future self—little time capsules of enthusiasm and ambition.

## The Beautiful Mess

My project folder is a beautiful mess, and I'm making peace with that. It's a testament to curiosity, to the willingness to try new things, to the courage to start even when finishing isn't guaranteed.

Every developer I know has their own version of this chaos. We're all building our own empires of unfinished dreams, collecting half-implemented ideas like digital artifacts of our restless creativity.

And maybe that's okay. Maybe the world needs more starters than finishers. Maybe the exploration is the point. Maybe my brain's love affair with new things isn't a bug—it's exactly what makes me a good developer.

After all, in a field that reinvents itself every six months, loving new things isn't just adaptive—it's essential.

So here's to the unfinished projects, the abandoned apps, the half-built dreams gathering dust in our repositories. Here's to the dopamine hits that get us started and the wisdom that helps us know when to stop. Here's to embracing the chaos and finding beauty in the mess.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I just had an idea for an app that helps developers manage their unfinished projects. This one's going to be different, I can feel it.
