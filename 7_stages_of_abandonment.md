**The 7 Stages of Abandoning a Project**

We’ve all been there. You start a project full of ambition, passion, and dreams of greatness. Maybe it’s a novel you’ve been meaning to write, an app you’re sure will change the world, or even just a home renovation project that you were *totally* going to finish. But somehow, somewhere along the way, life gets in the way. You lose interest. You lose momentum. Or maybe you just lose your mind trying to finish it.

And so begins the emotional journey of abandoning a project. Inspired by the classic “stages of grief,” here’s a deep dive into the seven emotional stages of throwing in the towel on that project you once swore you’d finish.

### 1. **Denial** – *“I’ll get back to it tomorrow.”*

This is where it all begins. You’re still in love with the idea, convinced that you’ll pick it up again soon. The project is simply “paused” for now. You tell yourself it’s just a quick break. That half-finished code, that barely-there manuscript, or that pile of unfinished DIY materials? All of it is *waiting* for your triumphant return. You’re not giving up, no way. It’s just a matter of time. Tomorrow. Or the next day. Or next week. It’ll happen. *Eventually.*

You justify the delay with some very convincing mental gymnastics: “I work better under pressure anyway!” “The inspiration will hit any minute!” “I just need to clean my desk and then I’ll focus!” But deep down, you know the truth. The longer you ignore it, the less likely you’ll actually get back to it.

### 2. **Guilt** – *“I should really be working on it right now.”*

Now the guilt starts creeping in. It’s like a shadow that follows you everywhere. You’re mindlessly scrolling through Instagram, giggling at cat videos, when suddenly, that project reappears in your brain like an unwanted pop-up ad. It haunts you in every quiet moment. “You should be working on it,” it whispers. You’re sitting on the couch, binge-watching the latest show everyone is talking about, and there it is again, looming over you: *“Shouldn’t you be working on your dream?”*

It’s like you’ve committed a crime by not working on it, and every Netflix episode, every coffee break, and every day you put it off just adds to your long list of project-based sins. And even though there’s no one around to judge you, you feel like you’re constantly being caught red-handed.

You get little pangs of guilt when you tell people about your “latest project” in conversations, but deep down, you know you’re just pushing the shame into a box and hoping it stays there. But it doesn’t. It pops up unexpectedly, like a little voice saying, “Hey, remember me?”

### 3. **Frustration** – *“Why isn’t this working?!”*

Eventually, you reach a point where you can no longer ignore the reality. You decide to give it another go—after all, what’s a better way to get rid of that guilt than by making some progress? You open up the files, dust off the materials, and dive in with fresh enthusiasm (or maybe a few too many cups of coffee).

But wait, what’s this? The bugs? The errors? The problems? They didn’t disappear when you weren’t looking. In fact, they seem to have multiplied. That once-brilliant idea that seemed so flawless is now riddled with complications you never even anticipated. It’s like trying to untangle a massive knot of Christmas lights: no matter how hard you pull, it just gets messier.

You start muttering things like, “Why isn’t this working?!” and “I know this is supposed to be easy!” It’s like the universe itself is conspiring to keep you from finishing, and you’re standing there, powerless, as the frustration builds. The creative spark that once made this project feel like *the one* is now buried under layers of stress, confusion, and maybe a few tears. 

### 4. **Bargaining** – *“If I just fix this one thing, I’ll finish the whole project.”*

Here’s where the real self-deception kicks in. You start making deals with yourself, bargaining like a medieval knight trying to escape the dungeon. “Okay,” you tell yourself, “If I can just fix this one little bug, I’ll be halfway done.” And then, once that’s fixed, you’ll tackle the next problem, and the next, until the project is finally, FINALLY done. You start convincing yourself that *this* is the breakthrough you’ve been waiting for.

You can almost picture the celebratory music playing in the background as you cross the finish line. But here’s the harsh truth: it doesn’t work like that. The one thing you fixed only opens the door to two more problems. And those problems bring their own, and before you know it, the end is nowhere in sight. 

The bargain is broken. You’re stuck in an endless loop of “just one more thing,” each more impossible than the last.

### 5. **Burnout** – *“I can’t even look at this anymore.”*

At this point, you’re exhausted. You’ve tried everything: multiple coffees, naps, and maybe even a good ol’ fashioned tantrum. But your passion has long since been drained, and the drive that once kept you awake at 3 AM is gone. You open the project files, and there’s a dull emptiness in your chest. You can’t even bring yourself to care. 

Every task feels like an insurmountable mountain, and your brain is begging you for a break. You look at your progress, and it feels like you’re trudging through molasses. All you can think is: *“I can’t even look at this anymore.”* You used to love it. You used to be excited about it. But now? It feels like a chore. And the worst part is: there’s no end in sight. 

It’s burnout. You don’t have the energy or the willpower to keep going, and frankly, the thought of continuing feels more exhausting than just letting it go.

### 6. **Avoidance** – *“What project? I don’t remember any project.”*

This is the stage where you go full stealth mode. The project? What project? You’ve already stuffed it into the deepest corners of your mind, and now you’re burying it in layers of distractions and procrastination. Every time someone asks about it, you suddenly become an expert in changing the subject. 

If anyone dares to mention it, you casually brush it off. “Oh, that? Yeah, I’ll get to it one day…” You start avoiding even the thought of it. It’s like that ex who you just can’t face anymore—too many unresolved issues, too much awkwardness.

Your project is gathering digital dust in the back of your computer, hidden behind folders with names like “Random Stuff” and “Old Files.” It’s been pushed to the back burner so many times it’s practically invisible.

### 7. **Acceptance** – *“This isn’t happening, and that’s okay.”*

And here we are. The final stage. You’ve made peace with it. The project is not going to be finished. You’re not going to work on it. And you’re okay with that. 

You’ve accepted the reality: not every idea needs to come to fruition. Not every project needs to be completed. And that’s perfectly fine. In fact, maybe you learned more about yourself by walking away than you ever would have by pushing through. 

It might not be the grand triumph you envisioned, but there’s wisdom in knowing when to let go. After all, this project served its purpose—whether that was teaching you a lesson in perseverance or in knowing when to throw in the towel. And hey, maybe one day you’ll circle back to it, or maybe you’ll leave it in the past with fond memories of what could have been.

But for now, you close the project folder. You take a deep breath. You move on.

And just like that, a fresh new project catches your eye. You’re ready to do it all again. Because that’s the beauty of it—you never stop trying. Every unfinished project is just another step on the road to discovering what truly *lights you up*. Keep moving forward, because the next big idea could be right around the corner.

And remember: failure is just the universe’s way of nudging you to try something else. So go ahead, close that file, and open a new one. After all, there’s always something new to start.
