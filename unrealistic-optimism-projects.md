**Unfinished Side Projects I Swear I’ll Get Back To**

Let’s be real for a second. We all have that one (or twenty) half-finished projects lurking in the dark corners of our digital graveyard. The ones we start with the best of intentions, armed with boundless enthusiasm and a vision of changing the world. But life happens, and suddenly we find ourselves staring at a forgotten folder, wondering what on earth we were thinking when we dove in headfirst.

Well, here’s a look at some of my *favorite* unfinished side projects—each with an ambitious goal, an unrealistic dose of optimism, and, of course, the inevitable “death date” when reality hit.

**1. AI for Renewable Energy Optimization (AI/ML)**  
   - **Concept**: Picture this—an AI that analyzes energy consumption patterns and optimizes renewable energy sources like solar and wind, in real-time, to reduce waste and maximize efficiency.  
   - **Why it was abandoned**: I quickly realized that combining machine learning with renewable energy at the scale I envisioned required data (and a lot of it) that I didn’t have access to. Plus, the complexity of integrating AI with power grids was a little... well, *out of my league*.  
   - **Unrealistic Optimism**: "I’ll just throw a few algorithms at this, and boom—instant energy revolution!"  
   - **Death Date**: **October 15, 2024** – The moment I realized AI wasn’t just a plug-and-play solution for world energy problems.

**2. Smart Water Management System (IoT)**  
   - **Concept**: A clever network of IoT devices that tracks water usage, detects leaks, and optimizes consumption to save both water and money.  
   - **Why it was abandoned**: Spoiler alert: IoT isn’t as simple as slapping sensors on everything. Connecting all the devices, dealing with the hardware issues, and handling the data in real-time proved to be more of a nightmare than a smart solution.  
   - **Unrealistic Optimism**: "I’ll save the planet one drop of water at a time with a few sensors and a cool dashboard!"  
   - **Death Date**: **November 1, 2024** – The point where the sensors just weren’t *sensing* and the project felt more like a flood than a fix.

**3. Global Disaster Relief Platform (Web Dev.)**  
   - **Concept**: A dynamic platform designed to connect volunteers, organizations, and resources in real-time during global disasters, making relief efforts more efficient and coordinated.  
   - **Why it was abandoned**: Let’s just say I didn’t factor in the scale of data and security needed. Integrating real-time disaster information from multiple sources? Yeah, that wasn’t as easy as I thought.  
   - **Unrealistic Optimism**: "One website, and I’ll change the way the world handles disaster relief. Piece of cake!"  
   - **Death Date**: **December 10, 2024** – When I discovered my platform couldn’t even handle a basic earthquake simulation without crashing.

**4. Carbon Footprint Tracker (Web Dev.)**  
   - **Concept**: A sleek, user-friendly app that helps users track and reduce their carbon footprint by analyzing their daily activities and suggesting greener alternatives.  
   - **Why it was abandoned**: The data required to calculate carbon footprints accurately was a nightmare to source. And integrating a bunch of third-party APIs didn’t exactly go as planned.  
   - **Unrealistic Optimism**: "Everyone’s going to love tracking their carbon footprint, and they’ll definitely care about reducing it after using this app!"  
   - **Death Date**: **December 15, 2024** – When I realized I couldn’t even track a simple cup of coffee without hitting a wall of incomplete data.

**5. Sustainable Shopping App (App Dev.)**  
   - **Concept**: An app that helps people find eco-friendly, ethically sourced products by scanning barcodes and comparing the environmental impact of items in-store.  
   - **Why it was abandoned**: My optimistic self didn’t factor in the monumental task of sourcing accurate environmental data for thousands of products, nor did I anticipate the difficulty of convincing brands to participate.  
   - **Unrealistic Optimism**: "I’ll make eco-friendly shopping the default. It’ll be so easy that people will *have* to choose sustainability!"  
   - **Death Date**: **January 12, 2025** – When I realized I couldn’t find a reliable product database, let alone persuade companies to join the movement.

---

**6. Environmental Awareness Game (Game Dev.)**  
   - **Concept**: A fun, educational game where players learn about climate change, sustainability, and the environment through interactive challenges and mini-games.  
   - **Why it was abandoned**: The idea of blending entertainment and education is genius, but balancing both without sacrificing one for the other proved way harder than expected. Oh, and the game engine had a *few* performance issues.  
   - **Unrealistic Optimism**: "I’ll make saving the planet fun and engaging. Kids will be begging to play this game!"  
   - **Death Date**: **February 14, 2025** – When my code couldn’t even handle a simple animation without lagging, let alone an entire educational game.

**The Takeaway**  
It’s easy to dream big and think that a couple of hours of coding (or some very ambitious planning) will turn ideas into reality. But here’s the truth: good ideas require a lot more time, resources, and, honestly, a fair bit of humility to bring them to life. While these projects may have been prematurely abandoned, who knows? Maybe one day they’ll rise from the ashes of my digital graveyard. Until then, I’ll keep dreaming, learning, and improving.

Have you got any unfinished projects haunting you? Share your digital graveyard with me—I’d love to know what *was* going to change the world before life got in the way.
